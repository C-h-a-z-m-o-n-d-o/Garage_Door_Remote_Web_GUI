# Garage_Door_Remote_Web_GUI


This project is something I am currently working on, so files will be added as of when they are created and suitable. The goal is to create a way of opening and closing my garage doors via a smartphone using a Web-based GUI and a raspberry pi in conjunction with a transmitter. Using custom code and hardware.
